- **Option 2:** Coffee shop (warm, casual vibe)
- **Option 3:** Home office with good lighting
- **Option 4:** Standing in front of a window (natural light)

## EDITING TIPS

1. **Pacing:** Keep cuts quick (2–5 seconds per scene) to maintain attention
2. **Text overlays:** Add keywords ("One-click upload," "Auto-thumbnails," "Multi-platform") during demo
3. **Zoom on UI:** Slightly zoom in on important buttons/text so viewers see them clearly
4. **Transitions:** Smooth fades or simple cuts; avoid overly complex animations
5. **Music:** Low volume, upbeat tech/startup vibes (royalty-free: Epidemic Sound, Artlist, YouTube Audio Library)
6. **Captions:** Burn-in or use LinkedIn captions; ensure they're on-brand and readable
